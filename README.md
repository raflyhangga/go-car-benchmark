# go-car
Golang CAR cache

This repository is a fork from [stfnmllr's Go Car](https://github.com/stfnmllr/go-car). With some additional code to record the algorithm's performance.

Goal of this repository is to compare libCacheSim's CAR (Clock with Adaptive Replacement) implementation with Go Car's implementation.

To run the benchmark:
```
go run main.go
```
